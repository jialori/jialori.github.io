## About Me
##### Get to know me.

Hello! This is Lori Jia, a Computer Science student at The University of Toronto. Since I discovered my interest in creating games in September 2019, I've been working on two Unity games, _Trash Panda_ with a cross-disciplinary team, and _IR:IS_ by myself. 

After I found my passion in games, I started to become interested in _Computer Graphics_. I spend hours on websites like Shadertoy to explore and learn. Academically, I focused on _Artificial Intelligence_ and _Theory of Computation_. I also enjoy designing and developing to solve pain points in life. 

At times when I'm not pondering design decisions, learning code, or cramming for school, I watch anime, draw, or swim. 

You are welcome to view my portfolio, and feel free to get in touch!
