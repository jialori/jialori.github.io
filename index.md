## About Me

Hello! This is Lori Jia, a graduating Computer Science student from the University of Toronto. I specialized in Artificial Intelligence when in school. My other favorite subfields of computer science are product design and computer graphics. My career pursuit is to develop products with great practical value or artistic sense. 

I build games and websites on my own time, you can see some of my work in the previous section. At times when I'm not coding up products or pondering design decisions, I [draw](./draw.md), watch films and anime, or swim.

Thank you for viewing my portfolio. Please feel free to get in touch at jialori.LJ@gmail.com for career opportunities, any questions you may have, or just casual talks.
