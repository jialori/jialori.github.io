## About Me

Hello! This is Lori Jia, a Computer Science student at The University of Toronto. Since I discovered my interest in creating games in September 2019, I've been working on two Unity games, _Trash Panda_ with a cross-disciplinary team, and _IR:IS_ by myself. 

After I found my passion for games, I started to become interested in _Computer Graphics_. I spend hours on websites like Shadertoy to explore and learn. Academically, I focused on _Artificial Intelligence_. As it may apply to every engineer, I also enjoy designing and developing for little pain points in everyday life. 

At times when I'm not pondering design decisions, learning code, or cramming for school, I watch anime, [draw](./draw.md), or swim. 

You are welcome to view my portfolio, and feel free to get in touch!

interest: web development, graphics programming, and all creative aspects. I like computer science because it's what builds useful gadget, cool products and elegant tools.
