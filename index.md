## About Me

Hello, my name is Lori Jia. I am a software developer currently working as an intern (remotely) in Tecent Interactive Entertainment Group. On my own time, I design and develop products and games. At times when I'm not coding, I [doodle](./draw.md) and binge-watch films.
<!-- As a self-entitled designer, I believe technology makes lives better only when the we design them with conscientious minds.-->

Thank you for viewing my portfolio. Feel free to get in touch with me at jialori.LJ@gmail.com for career or collaboration opportunities, any questions you may have, or casual talks :).
